The design of Simple Library is fairly simple, the initial goal was to have a DApp to be used within local communities or smaller libraries enabling P2P book sharing for all participants.

- Lenders list books to be shared.
- Borrowers deposit quoted funds to borrow the listed books.
- Once they return the book, and the lender marks it returned, their deposit is reimbursed to them.
- There is thereby no net-gain or net-loss within the system except for the transaction fees.

One of the major decisions was to not allow Borrowers to mark their books returned as they could theorotically keep the book and the money too. Assuming the lending rates would be more on the fairer range for used books, it seemed sufficient to allow the lenders to mark it returned.

In future there could be more controls added to enable more detailed tracking and funds transfer.
